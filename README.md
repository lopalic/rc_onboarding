# RC onboarding

This is the idea for an onboarding repository for RubyCode.

Everything included in this repository should be enough to get you started working on any Ruby project.

Convenient links to the other parts of this repository:

1. [Ruby basics](ruby_basics/)
2. [Ruby OOP](ruby_oop/)
3. [Git](git/)
4. [Linux](linux/)

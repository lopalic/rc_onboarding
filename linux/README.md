# Linux

This chapter will cover the following topics, split over knowledge levels:
0. [I just want to listen and watch videos, no reading please!](videos/)
1. [Basic](basic/)
2. [Intermediate](intermediate/)
3. [Advanced](advanced/)

The first topic, going under videos is probably the best one, but you can hopefully use the rest as a sort of a refference when you need a quick reminder on something.

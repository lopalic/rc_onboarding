# Functions

Functions are reusable sections of code that perform specific tasks in our program/script.

Using functions means that we can write simple, more easily readable code by removing the complexity from other locations and putting in fuctions, smaller bite-sized pieces of code.

For example, a function could look like this:
```
def my_first_function
  # whatever you want your function to do
end
```

The `def` keyword begins the header of the function.
This will include the name of the function, along with any parameters the function will take(covered in the next chapter).
The body of the fucntion will contain the code that we want it to execute.
The function end with the `end` keyword.

To call a given function, you simply need to call its name, so for example, if you wanted to call `my_first_function` in your program/script, you would have a line saying `my_first_function` anywhere in your program/script.

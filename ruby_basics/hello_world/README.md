# Hello world!

Writing a program that prints out "Hello world!" doesn't get much easier than it is with Ruby!

For example, you could write a file that contains just the following:

```
puts 'Hello world!'
```

in a file (the extension does not matter at all if you're working on Linux) and run:

```
ruby <my_file>
```

replacing the filename with whatever you named it and it would print out `'Hello world!'`.

You can try this out if you've cloned this repository by running `ruby hello` from this directory.

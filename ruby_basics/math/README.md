# Math

You can use Ruby to perform mathematical calculations.
The four standard operators are probably familiar to you:

- `+` for addition
- `-` for subtraction
- `*` for multiplication
- `/` for division

The two other less familiar operators are `**` and `%`.

`**` is used for exponents in the format of `<base value>**<power>`.

For example, `5**2` would mean `5 to the power of 2` or `5^2`, which evaluates to `25`.

`%` is the modulo operator. This operation provides the remained of a division operation.

For example, `5%2` would mean `5 modulo 2` or `the remained of 5/2`, which would be `1` for this example.

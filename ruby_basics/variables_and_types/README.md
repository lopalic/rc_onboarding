# Variables and types

Variables are a named piece of data. You can use a variable to store a value within your program/script, and refer to it later by using the variable name.

Varibales in Ruby are defined using `=`, for example:

`my_first_variable = "This is my first variable!"`

Once you've assigned a value to a variable, you can access its value by referring to it, for example, if you wanted to print the value of `my_first_variable` you could do something like this:

`puts my_first_variable`

There are three main types of variables in Ruby:

- Strings (a single or a collection of characters within quotation marks (`'` or `"`)
- Booleans (true or false)
- Numbers (numeric values)

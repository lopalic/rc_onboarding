# Pry Debugger

This is, hands down, the awesomest thing to exist in Ruby.

Anywhere in your code, you can write `binding.pry`, if pry is included as a gem in your project and your program/script will stop there.

At that point, you can look around the current environment using a simple `ls` command.
This allows you to see all the methods and functions that are available to you at that specific point where you wrote `binding.pry`.

You can look into what a given object can do by simply doing `ls <whatever object is available at this point>`. 
This allows you to see the class and the methods that are available to you from that particular object.

You can do anything the code is supposed to do manually and check how it behaves.

You can even interract with the variables and objects that you have available to you and change them how you see fit and run the program/script from that point on as if you made alterations to the variable or object you wanted to and it behaves just like you did exactly that.

Amazing to say the least, words cannot describe how amazing of an experience this debugger is, look for any resource regarding the pry debugger online and you can't go wrong, any tutorial on it is an 11/10 and a must read/watch for any Ruby developer.

This is the end of the Ruby basics, you can only go back to the repository root from here and continue with Ruby OOP.

# What is Ruby?

Before saying anything else about Ruby, it is first and foremost a script language.

This means that it is **NOT** compiled and, is instead, **evaluated**.

This means, that unlike the C family of languages(C, C++, C#, etc.) or, for example Java, the code you write can be ran without the need for a compiler!

## Pros:

- Faster to write code
- Faster to get an idea working
- Faster to test things out without depending on anything at all
- Doesn't care much about syntax, pretty much anything that's working can be interpreted into a working script/program
- Simple and easy to understand code


## Cons:

- Running a script shell within a script shell is probably one of the slowest thing in the world
- Can be tedious to debug if there are environment differences between shells or OS-es

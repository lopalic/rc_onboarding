# Git

There are many resources to learn about and how to use Git, but the following are two great starting points:

1. [Introduction to Git with Scott Chacon of GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR433b0HJY)
2. [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

These resources should contain more than enought examples and explanations on what to do with Git than you would ever need.

Just remember, take it slow, don't rush things if you don't understand them at first, if everything is too much to take in at once, find a simple way of workign for yourself, stick to it and build up from there!
